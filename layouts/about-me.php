							Hello ! My name is Julien, born in 1989 I'm a Data Scientist and Software Engineer. I did my study in the city of Lille, in the north of France. I started my career by doing web development before orienting my path to Statistics and Data Science. In that domain I love to treat data and develop models, my pleasure resisdes in the fact of seeing the accuracy indicators rising up due to my work.   
						</p>
						<p>To do that, I use Machine Learning methods with Python. I created my own small library with functions found on the web or created myself.
